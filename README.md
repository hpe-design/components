# Components

components can be used to build a variety of HPE web sites, pages and applications that are a key way to showcase our brand to employees, customers and partners. In this section you will find the elements to help build your experience to meet hpe.com standards, as well as a set of typographic and color styles on a variety of platforms to help you with your development look and feel.

## Grommet

grommet is a react-based framework that provides accessibility, modularity, responsiveness, and theming in a tidy package. It's also the de-facto UI framework HPE uses to build apps and websites. All of our component design files works especially well when paired with grommet! Go check it out and tell your devs!

## Sketch

There are two ways to use the Sketch Component Library; One, by manually downloading the Sketch file that contains the entire symbol library (best for folks that want to enhance the design and contribute ideas to the brand) or, Two, add the Sketch Library (read-only) version that automagically updates from the Cloud! The later, being better for folks that just want to use the standard elements and ensure they're always up to date.
